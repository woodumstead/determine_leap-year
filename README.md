# determine leap year

Using an if else statement, determine if a year is a leap year or not.


A leap year is a 
    * year that can divided by 4 evenly.
    * except if it is divisible by 100.
    * except if it is divisible by 400.

    If is divisible by 4 then we must make check if it is divisible by 100. 
    If it is then we must check if it is divisible by 400. 
    If so then it is a leap year!
